This suggests that while the SAREnv library might be partially imported, the `PathEvaluator` class is either not in that module or there's another underlying import issue within that specific module. Given that the paper explicitly mentions evaluation scripts and the file `04_evaluate_coverage_paths.py` exists in the examples directory, it's more likely that the evaluation logic is meant to be run directly from these scripts which might handle imports or dependencies differently than a direct import in the notebook.

This might be due to how the `!python` command executes in this environment or other environment-specific issues with path manipulation. A more robust approach to running a script from a subdirectory that depends on a package in the parent directory is to execute the script using the `-m` flag as a module, or to run it directly from the parent directory. Since the script is in the `examples` directory, running it as a module relative to the parent `SAREnv` directory is a good approach.

            "- **Library Versions and Dependencies:** Slight differences in the versions of Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, etc.) used during the evaluation can sometimes affect numerical results.\n",
            "- **Stochasticity:** For algorithms that involve randomness (such as RandomWalk), if the random seeds were not set identically between the paper's evaluation environment and the reproduction environment, minor variations in path generation and subsequent evaluation metrics can occur.\n",
            "- **Dataset Variations:** Although Git LFS was used, subtle differences in how the dataset files were handled or interpreted in different environments could theoretically lead to minor variations, though this is less likely.\n",

        "*   Minor discrepancies (generally within a few percentage points) were observed between the reproduced results and the paper's results, likely due to factors like floating-point precision, library versions, or stochastic differences. For instance, RandomWalk showed differences of around 3-4% across metrics, while Pizza showed smaller differences under 1% for Likelihood Score and Time-Discounted Score.\n",
